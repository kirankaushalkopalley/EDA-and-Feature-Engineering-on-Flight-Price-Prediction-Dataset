# EDA and Feature Engineering on Flight Price Prediction Dataset
 
Welcome to the Flight Price Prediction repository! This project is designed to help you perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on a dataset containing flight information in a step-by-step manner. The goal is to prepare the data for efficient use in machine learning models, specifically for predicting flight prices.

### Overview
This repository includes two Excel workbooks:
* __Training Data Workbook:__ Contains the data used for training machine learning models.
* __Test Data Workbook:__ Contains the data for which flight prices need to be predicted.

### Project Agenda
The main focus of this project is to perform the following tasks:

* __Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and gain insights that will guide further processing.
* __Feature Engineering:__ Enhance the dataset by creating new relevant features or transforming existing ones. This step aims to improve the performance of machine learning models.
